SpaceInvadersClone
==================

A Space Invaders clone using the game framework that I developed.

This Space Invaders clone shows how the game framework can be used to make 2D classic arcade games.

When you clone this repo, make sure you also clone the *[GameFramework](https://github.com/garyfredgiger/GameFramework.git)* project in this same repo. Before building the project, make sure you add the GameFramework project to this project under the menu options

1) Right click on the project and select Build Path -> Configure Build Path
2) Click on the Projects tab and add the GameFramework project, then click the OK button.

This game was developed using Eclipse Kepler Release (Build id: 20130614-0229) with Java 1.6.
